# Seedvault
[![Build](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3ABuild)

A backup application for the [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/).

If you are having an issue/question, please look at our [FAQ](../../wiki/FAQ).

## Components

* [Local Contacts Backup](contactsbackup) - an app that backs up local on-device contacts
* [Storage library](storage) - a library handling efficient backup of files
* [Seedvault app](app) - the main app where all functionality comes together

## Features
- Backup application data to a flash drive.
- Restore application data from a flash drive.
- User-friendly encryption using a mnemonic phrase (BIP39).
- Automatic daily backups that run in the background.

## Requirements

SeedVault is developed alongwith AOSP releases

We update it every time Google releases a new Android version, make any changes required for basic functionality, and any improvements possible through API changes in the OS.

This means that for ROMs using SeedVault it's recommended to use the same branch as your android version

- This current branch `android13` is meant for usage with Android 13
- This is indicated by the version name starting with `13`, and the version code starting with `33` - the Android 13 API version

For older versions of Android, check out [the branches](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/branches).

Trying to use an older branch on a newer version may lead to issues and is not something we can support.

## Getting Started
- Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/wiki) for information on building the application with 
AOSP.

## What makes this different?
This application is compiled with the operating system and does not require a rooted device for use.
It uses the same internal APIs as `adb backup` which is deprecated and thus needs a replacement.

## Permissions
* `android.permission.BACKUP` to back up application data.
* `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` to check if there is internet access when network storage is used.
* `android.permission.MANAGE_USB` to access the serial number of USB mass storage devices.
* `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` to change system backup settings and enable call log backup.
* `android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` to get information about all installed apps for backup.
* `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES` to re-install apps when restoring from backup.
* `android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to backup and restore files from device storage.
* `android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` to backup original media files e.g. without stripped EXIF metadata.
* `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` to do periodic storage backups without interruption.
* `android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` to retrieve the available storage roots (optional) for better UX.
* `android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC` to authenticate saving a new recovery code
* `android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL` to use storage roots in other users (optional).
* `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` to inform users about backup status and errors.
