# Seedvault
[![Build](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3ABuild)

A backup application for the [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/).

If you are having an issue/question, please look at our [FAQ](../../wiki/FAQ).

## Components

* [Local Contacts Backup](contactsbackup) - an app that backs up local on-device contacts
* [Storage library](storage) - a library handling efficient backup of files
* [Seedvault app](app) - the main app where all functionality comes together

## Features
- Backup application data to a flash drive.
- Restore application data from a flash drive.
- User-friendly encryption using a mnemonic phrase (BIP39).
- Automatic daily backups that run in the background.

## Requirements

- Android 12

For older versions of Android, check out [the branches](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/branches).

## Getting Started
- Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/wiki) for information on building the application with 
AOSP.

## What makes this different?
This application is compiled with the operating system and does not require a rooted device for use.
It uses the same internal APIs as `adb backup` which is deprecated and thus needs a replacement.

## Permissions
* `android.permission.BACKUP` to back up application data.
* `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` to check if there is internet access when network storage is used.
* `android.permission.MANAGE_USB` to access the serial number of USB mass storage devices.
* `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` to change system backup settings and enable call log backup.
* `android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` to get information about all installed apps for backup.
* `android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES` to re-install apps when restoring from backup.
* `android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to backup and restore files from device storage.
* `android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` to backup original media files e.g. without stripped EXIF metadata.
* `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` to do periodic storage backups without interruption.
* `android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` to retrieve the available storage roots (optional) for better UX.
* `android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC` to authenticate saving a new recovery code
* `android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL` to use storage roots in other users (optional).
