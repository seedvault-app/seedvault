    Normally, restoring from backup is only available during initial device setup.
    You can make it always available at your own risk.
    Keep in mind that the Auto-Restore feature works independently from this.

    Launch an intent with the action "com.stevesoltys.seedvault.RESTORE_BACKUP"

    Android App Bundles split up the app into several APKs.
    We always back up all the available split APKs
    and do a compatibility check when re-installing them.
    If a backed up split is not compatible, the re-install will fail
    and the user will be given the opportunity to install the app manually before data restore.
    Unknown splits are treated as compatible as we haven't yet seen a case
    where this would cause a problem such as an app crashing when starting it after re-install.
    However, if you prefer to be on the safe side, you can set this to true,
    to only install unknown splits if they come from the same device.
